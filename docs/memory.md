## 🛣️ Strategic Roadmap
| Version | Theme | Key Features | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **V2.31** | Rivals | Scoop Limits, Pre-register, Emergency Grant | ✅ Done |
| **V2.32** | Transparency | Rival Progress Bar, Thesis Roadmap | ✅ Done |
| **V2.33** | Momentum | Curriculum (Skills), Workshop Papers | ✅ Done |
| **V2.34** | **The Defense** | **Interactive Thesis Defense Minigame** | 📅 **Next** |
| **V3.0** | Gold Release | Narrative Endings, Soundscapes, Polish | 📅 Planned |

## 🧠 Key Logic/Rules Established
* **Thesis**: Requires 1+ Papers + 100% Thesis Progress + Quals Passed.
* **Rivals**: Progress independently; countered by "Pre-Register" or "Coordinate". Max 1 scoop/12mo.
* **Funding**: Starts at 36mo. Hitting 0 triggers "Teaching Load" (-50% speed). Escapable via Emergency Grant.
* **Curriculum**: Credits spent on tiered courses (Foundation 5cr, Advanced 10cr, Capstone 15cr).
* **Workshops**: Max 2/year, +5% journal boost each.
* **Specializations**:
    * 🔬 **Experimentalist**: Protocol Reuse (Faster Figures).
    * 📐 **Theoretician**: Auto-Idea (Once/Year).
    * 💻 **Computational**: Pipeline Optimization (+50% analysis/thesis speed).
