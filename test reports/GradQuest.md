The V2.35 Tab Navigation is already committed and pushed. Let me terminate the stale command:

### Planner Response

V2.35 is already deployed. What would you like to continue with?

**Current options:**
1. **Test the tab navigation** - I can open the browser to verify the mobile layout
2. **Refine the tabs** - Make tabs actually show/hide content panels instead of just scrolling
3. **Proceed to V3.0** - Start implementing the "Gold Release" features (Defense minigame, Narrative endings, Soundscapes)
4. **Something else** - Let me know what you have in mind

### User Input

1. Test the tab navigation - I can open the browser to verify the mobile layout
2. Refine the tabs - Make tabs actually show/hide content panels instead of just scrolling
3. Better visualize the  panels top, pls use a dedicated tab for them so that ppl will not miss info, since ppl have to scroll back and forth

I see the issue! The game is stuck in "waiting for acknowledge" state but the modal isn't showing. Let me fix this:

*Grep searched codebase*

### Planner Response

Found it! The issue is that the action "Read Event" is shown when `waitingForAcknowledge` is true, but the modal might have been dismissed or isn't showing. The problem is the old text says "Click 'Continue' to proceed" but the Continue button was removed from the event panel.

Let me also check if the modal is properly showing:

*Viewed [index.html](file:///Users/guozhenghui/Desktop/WXY/ComBio/GradQuest/docs/index.html) *

### Planner Response

I see the issue. The modal should show on page load if there was an event. The problem is the old "Read Event" action text references "Click Continue" but the Continue button was removed. The modal should be showing but might be hidden. Let me:

1. Update the "Read Event" action text
2. Re-show the modal if we're stuck waiting

### Planner Response

The modal bug is fixed and deployed. Here's a summary of the V2.37 mobile UX improvements:

## ✅ V2.37 Summary

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Centered Event Modal** | Events show in large centered popup |
| **Continue Button** | Must confirm to dismiss modal |
| **View Event Action** | Can re-open modal if hidden |
| **Event Panel** | Now info-only (no button) |

**Live at**: https://xy-vince.github.io/GradQuest/

The modal should now properly dismiss and unlock actions when you tap "Continue".

Do you want me to:
1. Test anything else?
2. Update the CHANGELOG/memory.md with all Mobile UX changes?
3. Proceed to V3.0 "Gold Release" features (Defense minigame)?
