Scoops are no longer random spam:

| Constraint | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| 12-month cooldown | Max 1 scoop per year |
| 80% warning | "🚨 Rival is rushing a preprint!" |
| 90%+ required | Scoop needs high progress AND stress |
| Thesis immunity | Progress decays during defense phase |

### 📋 Pre-register Idea
New counterplay action:
- **Cost**: -5 morale

## [2.29.0] - 2026-01-08 "Academic Survival"

**Theme**: Waiting becomes decision-making under pressure — funding suffocates, reviews demand responses.

### 📊 Centralized Modifier System
All status effects now use a central resolver:

| Modifier | Teaching Load | Fresh Perspective | Exhaustion |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|------------|
| Research Speed | ×0.5 | ×1.2 | ×0.8 |
| Thesis Speed | ×0.6 | — | ×0.8 |

## [2.27.0] - 2026-01-07 "The Living Lab"

**Theme**: GradQuest becomes a place, not a spreadsheet — labmates with agency, not flavor.

### 🧪 Labmate System
Two NPCs with their own progress, stress, loyalty, and events:

| Archetype | Role | Behavior |
|-----------|------|----------|
| 🎓 **The Senior** | Mentor figure | Leaves in 12-18 months, provides network |
| ⚔️ **The Rival** | Competitor | Publishes competitively, may sabotage |

### 📊 NPC Stats
Each labmate tracks hidden state:
- **progress** (0-100): Toward their next publication
- **stress** (0-100): Affects behavior
- **loyalty** (-50 to +50): Toward player
- **monthsRemaining**: Senior departure countdown

### ⚡ Forced Events
NPCs create unavoidable drama:
- **Rival Stress > 70**: Sabotage chance (scoop your idea, -10 morale)
- **Senior monthsRemaining = 3**: Departure warning
- **Senior leaves**: -15 network, -10 morale, thesis penalty if collaborated

### 📄 Publication Impact
- **Rival publishes**: -5 morale, +10 stress ("The pressure is on")
- **Senior publishes**: +5 morale, +5 network (lab reputation boost)

### 🤝 Collaboration System
- `collaborateWithLabmate()` action increases loyalty
- Senior collaborations give +3 alignment
- Dependency penalty if collaborator leaves

---

## [2.26.0] - 2026-01-07 "Advisor Personalities"

**Theme**: The humanization patch — advisors become systems with memory, not flavor text.

### 👹👻🧑‍🏫 Advisor Archetypes
Three distinct advisor types, assigned via field-weighted randomness:

| Archetype | Name | Philosophy | Field Bias |
|-----------|------|------------|------------|
| 👹 **The Tormentor** | Dr. Hardwick | "Results speak. Excuses don't." | Experimentalist |
| 👻 **The Ghost** | Dr. Phantom | "You'll figure it out." | Computational |
| 🧑‍🏫 **The Mentor** | Dr. Shepherd | "Slow progress is still progress." | Theoretician |

### 📊 Advisor Tension System
Hidden meter (0-100) that tracks advisor relationship:
- **Raises**: Actions the advisor dislikes
- **Lowers**: Actions the advisor approves
- **Warning** at 50: Archetype-specific concern message
- **Ultimatum** at 80: Serious consequences threat

### 🎭 Advisor-Owned Milestones
Key moments now have archetype-specific responses:
- **Quals Passed**: Tormentor → "That's the minimum." | Mentor → "I'm proud of you."
- **Paper Accepted**: Ghost → "Where next?" | Mentor → "Let's celebrate!"
- **Defense Ready**: Each archetype has unique framing

### 🔧 Implementation Details
- `ADVISOR_ARCHETYPES` constant with weights, triggers, modifiers
- `pickAdvisorByField()` - weighted random assignment
- `initializeAdvisor()` - creates advisor state with memory
- `updateAdvisorTension()` - called on every action

### 🎓 Defense Readiness System
Derived stat from thesis%, papers, alignment, network:
- `getDefenseReadiness()` calculates readiness score
- Qualitative text display: "Your committee seems cautiously optimistic"
- Score determines defense outcome variance

### 🛡️ Thesis Defense (One-Shot Event)
Four possible outcomes:

| Outcome | Score | Effect |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **PASS_WITH_DISTINCTION** | 85+ | PhD with honors, +20 academia score |
| **PASS** | 70-84 | PhD earned, normal career resolution |
| **CONDITIONAL_PASS** | 60-69 | +2 months revisions, -15 morale |
| **FAIL** | <60 | +6 months wait, -30 morale, +10 friction |

### 📝 Write Dissertation Action (With Risk)
- **Cost**: 15 morale per session
- **Gain**: 6-10% base + papers×4 + alignment bonus - friction penalty
- **Risk**: 20% chance of revision request → +3 committee friction
- **Block**: Stalls if morale < 20 (increases friction)
- **Requires**: 1+ published papers, quals passed

### 💼 Career Resolution System
Multi-factor scoring: academia vs industry
- **Academia signals**: papers, alignment, network
- **Industry signals**: network, internships, industry exposure
- **Specialization bias**: Computational → industry, Theoretician → academia
- **Defense modifier**: Distinction → +20 academia, Conditional → -10 academia

### 🗺️ Career Paths

## [2.8.0] - 2026-01-03 "Adaptive Resilience Phase 2"

Based on V2.7 73-month stress test (6-year PhD run). Tunes dominant loops while preserving realism.

### V2.7 Features (Now Documented)
- ⚠️ **Morale Warnings**: CRITICAL at ≤10%, EMERGENCY at ≤5%
- 📜 **End Screen**: Full history, seed display/copy, publication breakdown, advisor happiness

### Breaking Dominant Loops

#### Conference Early Caps
- **Year 1-2**: Max 1 conference per year (was always 2)
- **20% Alienating**: Early conferences may feel isolating (-3 morale)

#### Inspiration Tuning
- **Capped at 2/year**: No more inspiration farming
- **Diminishing returns**: 1st = +15 morale, 2nd = +10 morale
- **20% dead end**: Second inspiration may be flagged as dead end

#### Scoop Cooldown
- **6-month immunity** after being scooped (prevents back-to-back brutality)
- Tracks `lastScoopMonth` in state

#### MS-Out Intelligence
- **If ≥2 papers**: Disable MS-Out offer, give pep talk instead (+15-20 morale)
- Makes late-game MS-Out less absurd

### Balance Changes
- Inspiration reset yearly
- Conference caps tighter for new students
- Productive students get encouragement, not quit suggestions

## [2.7.0] - 2026-01-03 "Adaptive Resilience"

Based on 256-month stress test observations. Prevents infinite equilibrium and adds friction.

### Breaking Dominant Loops

#### Advisor Fatigue
- New state: `advisorInterventions` tracks vacation suggestions

- After 10 interventions: Advisor stops offering (no more vacation suggestions)
- 10% chance of "advisor stopped checking" message when struggling alone

#### Vacation Diminishing Returns
- New state: `vacationsThisYear` resets each year
- Each vacation reduces next gain by -5 morale (base 15-25 → min 5)
- Only first vacation of year clears burnout status
- Message changes to "diminishing returns" after 2+ vacations

#### Conference Caps
- Reduced from 3/year to **2/year** (after Year 1)
- Conferences now give +5 network (or +2 if network > 80)
- Morale gain halved when network > 80

#### Hard Variable Bounds
- Figures capped at 3 (prevents "4/3 needed" bug)
- Ideas capped at 5 (prevents hoarding)
- Key discoveries capped at 3
