## 📖 About

GradQuest is a **strategic PhD life simulator** that models the North American graduate school experience. It's not just about survival—it's about **resilience, strategy, and agency**.

**Core Philosophy:**
- Failures should feel **earned**, not random
- Recovery mechanics exist for those who **learn** from mistakes
- Degrees must be **earned**, not clicked through
- Time must be **felt**, outcomes must be **acknowledged**

## 🎯 Win Conditions

| Path | Requirements |
|------|--------------|
| **🎓 PhD** | 3 journal papers + thesis defense |
| **🚪 Master's Exit** | 30 credits + 18 months + advisor approval |

---

## 🔬 Field Specialization (V2.20+)

Choose your research identity at game start:

| Field | Accelerator | Key Traits |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| 🔬 **Experimentalist** | Protocol Reuse | Lab-based, equipment-dependent |
| 📐 **Theoretician** | Conceptual Breakthrough | Math-focused, abstract results |
| 💻 **Computational** | Pipeline Automation | Data-driven, server-dependent |

---

## 📑 Thesis Phases (V2.23)

Your thesis is a **gated project**, not a passive meter:

| Phase | Threshold | What Happens |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| 📝 **Planning** | 0% | Outline not yet approved |
| 📑 **Outline Approved** | 25% | +10 Alignment boost |

## 🎓 Career Endings (V2.18+)

Your final stats determine your career path:

**PhD Paths**: Tenure Track Professor, Research Scientist, Data Science Lead
**MS-Out Paths**: R&D Lead, Senior Data Scientist, Software Engineer, Career Pivot

---

## 🧑‍🏫 Advisor System

Your advisor has **hidden traits** affecting outcomes:

| Trait | Signals |
|-------|---------|
| **Risk Tolerance** | "I like bold ideas" vs cautious feedback |
| **Attention Span** | Fast vs slow response times |
